# dotQ
Yet another [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).

## Introduce

The following code shows a pretty common case of deeply nested callbacks in JavaScript. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that these nested callbacks will eventually become a bit of a headache:

	step1(function (value1) {
	  step2(value1, function(value2) {
	    step3(value2, function(value3) {
	      step4(value3, function(value4) {
	        // Do something with value4
	      });
	    });
	  });
	});

With the dotQ library, you can flatten the pyramid.

	require('dotq');

	step1.promise()
	  .then(function(value1) {
	    return step2.promise(value1);
	  })
	  .then(function(value2) {
	    return step3.promise(value2);
	  })
	  .then(function(value3) {
	    return step4.promise(value3);
	  })
	  .then(function(value4) {
	    // Do something with value4
	  });

## Difference between dotQ and Q
dotQ is based on Q. dotQ extends the `Function` object with a `promise` method in order to convert the Node.js style callback(`function(err, result)`) into a Q Promise.

What's more, the style of dotQ works better with the express-promise library. 

## Shortcuts

### map / reduce / filter / some / every
dotQ also extends the Q Promise with some useful methods of Array object. For example:

	function anAsyncFunction(number, callback) {
	  callback(null, [number, number + 1, number + 2]);
	}

	anAsyncFunction.promise(3)
	  .map(function(n) {
	    return n + 10;
	  })
	  .then(function(result) {
	    console.log(result); // [ 13, 14, 15 ]
	  });


## How to use
In node.js, Each file loaded shares the same primordial objects like Object, Array, etc,
so you can just require dotQ once in your initialization, after which you can use dotQ everywhere.
